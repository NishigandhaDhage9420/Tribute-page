<ul style="list-style-type:square" body bgcolor="#33475b">
<li>Mahatma Jyotirao Phule was born on April 11, 1827, and his birth anniversary is celebrated as Jyotiba Phule Jayanti every year.
  He and his wife, Savitribai Phule, were pioneers of women’s education in India.</li>
<li>
He started his first school for girls in 1848 in Pune at Tatyasaheb Bhide’s residence (Bhidewada). 
He, along with his followers, formed the Satyashodhak Samaj (Society of Truth Seekers) to attain equal rights for people from exploited 
castes. People from all religions and castes could become a part of this association which worked for the upliftment of the oppressed 
classes.

Mahatma Jyotirao Phule is regarded as an important figure in the social reform movement in Maharashtra. 
He was bestowed with the honorific Mahatma title by Maharashtrian social activist Vithalrao Krishnaji Vandekar in 1888.
</li>
<li>
He was also vocal against child marriage and supported the remarriage of widows. The reformer in 1863 along with this wife and a 
friend set up an infanticide prevention centre where pregnant widows could give birth and nurture their young ones.
</li>
<li>
Phule’s social activism included many fields including eradication of untouchability and the caste system, education of women and 
the Dalits, and welfare of downtrodden women.
</li>
<li>
Phule was also a member of the municipal council, author and merchant and was also engaged in the business of providing metal 
casting machinery to construction firms. Some of his renowned books include Shetkarayacha Aasud and Gulamgiri meaning cultivator’s 
whipcord and slavery, respectively.
</li>
<li>He was also a reputed author. His well known books include Gulamgiri (Slavery) and Shetkarayacha Aasud (Cultivator’s Whipcord).</li>
<li>
Apart from his role as a social activist, Phule was a businessman too. In 1882 he styled himself as a merchant, cultivator and municipal 
contractor.[44] He owned 60 acres (24 ha) of farmland at Manjri, near Pune.
</li>
<li>
Mahatma Jyotirao Phule was appointed commissioner (municipal council member) to the then Poona municipality in 1876 and served in this 
unelected position until 1883.[48]
</li>
<li>
Jyotiba Phule devoted his entire life for the liberation of untouchables from the exploitation of Brahmins. 
</li>
<li>
He suffered a stroke in 1888 and was rendered paralyzed. On 28 November, 1890, the great social reformer, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, 
passed away.
</li>
<li>
Perhaps the biggest legacy of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule is the thought behind his perpetual fight against social stigma that are 
enormously relevant still. In the nineteenth century, people were used to accepting these discriminatory practices as social norm that 
needed to be enforced without question but Jyotiba sought to change this discrimination based on caste, class and colour.
 He was the harbinger of unheard ideas for social reforms. He started awareness campaigns that ultimately inspired the likes of
  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi, stalwarts who undertook major initiatives against caste discrimination later.
